      <li class="list-group-item"><b>What is an Address?</b> An address is like an account at a financial institution or a post office box. It has a unique identifier that people can use to send digital items to you. Everyone is able to see what is inside your addresses, but you need your address Private Key (see below) in order to send something from that address to another address.
        Your Wallet ID is the way we know which wallet is yours. When you create a new wallet we generate a brand new random Wallet ID for you.
        This ID enables you to login and access your wallet so <span class="text-danger"><b>Please BACKUP/SAVE your Wallet ID</b></span> somewhere safe.
      If you lose it, you will not be able to access your wallet and will loose all of your coins.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><b>What is a Wallet?</b> A Wallet is a convenient way for you to organize your crypto-currency addresses. You can think of a Wallet as a portfolio that contains multiple accounts. Each wallet has a Wallet ID. When you create a new wallet we generate a brand new random Wallet ID for you.
        This ID enables you to login and access your wallet so <span class="text-danger"><b>Please BACKUP/SAVE your Wallet ID</b></span> somewhere safe.
      If you lose it, you will not be able to access your wallet and will loose all of your coins.</li>

      <li class="list-group-item"><b>Does MerchantCoin Wallet protect my Wallet?</b> We take wallet security very seriously. Please see <a href="http://mastercointalk.org/index.php?topic=712.0" target="_new">this post</a>
      on the Mastercoin forums for more information. 
    <li class="list-group-item"><b>What are Watch Only Addresses?</b> An address (in your wallet) which you can track its balances but does not have an associated private key.
    So your wallet can not create any transactions with it. You only view its balances. </li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><b>What is a Private Key?</b> A Private Key is needed to send digital coins or tokens from an address you own. It's used to sign any transaction before it can be
      broadcast to the network. The private key is the secret key used to generate your Address (<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key" target="_new">Wikipedia</a>).
      MerchantCoi Wallet allows you to import your private key in several formats (hex, base64, Wallet Import Format, Wallet Import Format Compressed).
      The Wallet Import Format (WIP) is probably the most common format and its private key will always start with the number <i><b>5</b></i>.
      The My Address page displays a little padlock <a href="/about/faq"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock" tooltip="Your Wallet has the Private key for this address"></span></a>
    for addresses with known private keys.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><b>How do I Add an Address to my Wallet?</b> On the 'My Addresses' page of your wallet you can add either a Watch Address or the Private Key for your address.
      If you add the Private key for your address, you are giving your wallet the ability to manage/create transactions which move your coins
    that are in that address. If you only add the address as a Watch address, you will have a read-only view of its balances and transaction history.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><b>How do I Create a New Address?</b> Need a new address? On the 'My Addresses' page simply click the 'Create New Address' button and we'll generate a
      completely new random bitcoin address/private key pair and add it to your wallet. You will be able to use it to send and receive coins immediately.
      <b>NOTE: Any time you add an address to your wallet you should make sure you backup/export your wallet.
      <span class="text-danger">If you lose your password/access to your wallet and don't have a backup your
    funds/coins are GONE and there is nothing we can do to help you retrieve it.</span></b></li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><b>How do I Backup My Wallet?</b>On the 'My Addresses' page you can export a copy of your wallet. This json file contains every address and
      private key (if known) for the addresses in your wallet at the time of backup. <b> If you add new addresses to your wallet you should immediately
    create a new backup, replacing your old backup.</b></li>

      <li class="list-group-item"><b>How long does it take for a transaction to show up in MerchantCoin Wallet?</b> When you send a transaction, it has be processed on the Bitcoin blockchain and confirmed as a valid transaction. It usually takes about 10 minutes for a transaction to be confirmed once. MerchantCoin Wallet displays a transaction when it has been confirmed 3 times (for increased confidence that the transaction is valid), so you can expect to see the transaction after about a half an hour, but that time may vary. </li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><b>How do I Send Coins?</b> After you sign in to your wallet, click the 'Send' link in the left sidebar to send coins from an address that has a private key in your wallet (see Private Keys above).</li>
